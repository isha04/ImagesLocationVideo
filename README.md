This project has three parts:

1) Photos - In this part the user can do the following:
    a) Click a picture in the app.  The clicked picture will be saved in the phone's image galery.
    b) Import a picture from the phone's image gallery

In-app persistance has been implemented using Core Data and FIleManager.

2) Videos - In this part, I am fetching videos from youtube and the user can play the videos within the app while exploring other videos.

3) Location - GoogleMaps opens inside the app and the user can see their current location. The user can also share their current location via different platforms (e.g. WhatsApp, Signal, etc.) installed in the phone.
